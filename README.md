# In-store Beacons App

## Project description

This is a base Store App with Bluetooth Low Energy functionality scanning for Beacons, BLE devices on reach. Once they are found, they are shown on the screen. Once the user walks away from the Beacon, the screen refreshes and the Beacon goes away from the screen.
