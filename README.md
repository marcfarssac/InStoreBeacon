# Project Title

In-store Beacons App

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system. 

### Prerequisites

You will need a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Beacon to be detected by the App. Also your device must be enabled with BLE to be able to detect the Beacons.

## Usage

After launching the Android App this will start searching for Beacons nearby. If found they will be shown on the screen with a short description of the bran, product and deal. 
When the user moves away from the Beacon this will disappear from the list. As soon as the user goes back to the Beacon, this will show up again on the list.
